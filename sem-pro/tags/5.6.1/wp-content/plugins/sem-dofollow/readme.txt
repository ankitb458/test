The Do Follow plugin removes the nofollow attribute that WordPress adds in comments.


== Description ==

The Do Follow plugin removes the nofollow attribute that WordPress adds in comments.

It will catch rel="nofollow", as well as things like rel='tag nofollow tag' that similar plugins will not always catch.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the `sem-dofollow` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Doesn't nofollow prevent comment spam? =

It never has, and it never will...

It's so inexpensive to spam a site that checking whether nofollow is around is not worth spending time on. Plus, spamming a site that is using nofollow will still generate clicks.

Not convinced? [A spammer's take on the topic](http://www.semiologic.com/2005/02/05/prepare-for-more-comment-spam-not-less/).


= Shouldn't this be the default WordPress behavior? =

It probably should... How about adding a vote in the [WordPress ideas](http://wordpress.org/extend/ideas/topic.php?id=1405)?
