Future developments
-------------------

	* Dofollow for "trusted commenters" only.

I remain fairly open to suggestions regarding what a "trusted commenter" is. I currently see two potential solutions:

	* Checking for a minimum number of comments, to cripple "comment and run" SEO tactics
	* Having commenters and moderators manually whitelist and/or blacklist commenters through votes, as in a credence-like karma system

Regarding the whitelisting and blacklisting, I think that distributing the work of identifying (un-)trustworthy commenters by propagating whitelists and blacklists on a "the friend/enemy of my friend is my friend/enemy" basis may significantly reduce the workload.
