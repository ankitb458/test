When activated, this plugin prevents email notification when the blog admin posts a comment.  The theory is that the blog author knows she's commenting by dint of the fact that she's typing a reply.  As such, she probably doesn't need an email to let her know that she just commented.

Currently this only suppresses emails when the admin comments. I'll leave it as an exercise to the reader to suppress emails when the post author comments.
