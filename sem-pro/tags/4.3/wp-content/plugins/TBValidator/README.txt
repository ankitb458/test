Prerequisites:

 * An installation of WordPress version 1.5 or later

Installation:

 1. Move the TBValidator directory (included in the same zipfile containing
    this README) to the "plugins" subdirectory of the "wp-content" directory
    in your WordPress installation directory.  That is, if your blog lives in

        /home/you/wordpress
    
    then the TBValidator directory should appear at

        /home/you/wordpress/wp-content/plugins/TBValidator

 2. Using the Wordpress administration interfaec, turn on the Validator from 
    the "Plugins" page.

 3. The "Options" page will now have an additional tab, "Trackback Validator," 
    which allows you to configure the plugin and to see a graph of recent 
    trackback classifications.
