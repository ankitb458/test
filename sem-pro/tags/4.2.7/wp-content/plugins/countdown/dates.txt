*** A handful of religious holidays ***
12-25 Christmas
easter Easter Sunday
2 days before easter Good Friday
1 week before easter Palm Sunday

*** Most religious holidays move based on lunar cycles, 
*** so it is difficult to compute calendar dates for them.
*** At least, I don't know the math to do it.
*** PHP includes an internal table of Easter dates,
*** and so they are easier to include.
*** This isn't a religios bias, just a technical limitation.
