military veteran and author of 15 books on military history, retired
Lt. Col Michael Lee Lanning, has penned a new "introductory" book&nbsp; to
the Civil War titled, <a name="evtst|a|1402206593" href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1402206593?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mikescivilwar-20&amp;link_code=as3&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=1402206593">"Civil War 100: The Stories Behind the Most Influential Battles, People and Events in the War Between the States "</a>.&nbsp;  Lanning presents the war by ranking 100 events, leaders, and battles in order of importance.</p>

<p><strong>Book description</strong></p>

<blockquote>The Civil War was the defining event in American history. To explain why this is, The <em>Civil War 100</em>
uses a truly novel approach to analyze the respective importance of the
events, leaders and battles of America’s most important war.<br>
<br>
Starting with the Battle of Antietam, celebrated veteran and military
expert Michael Lee Lanning explains why it is the war’s single most
influential occurrence. Thus introducing the war’s various causes and
its primary players, Lanning embarks upon ranking the remaining 99
entries as a way of evaluating their relative influence over the
outcome of the war. These subsequent entries include more battles,
outspoken politicians, military heroes, causes of the conflict as
diverse as the Missouri Compromise of 1820 and the novel Uncle Tom’s
Cabin and, of course, monumental events such as the Emancipation
Proclamation and the Gettysburg Address.</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;So what are Lanning's top 10 in order of importance?</p>

<ul><li>Battle of Antietam</li><li>Abraham Lincoln</li><li>Ulysses Simpson Grant</li><li>Battle of Gettysburg</li><li>Robert Edward Lee</li><li>William Tecumseh Sherman</li><li>Battle of Vicksburg</li><li>Philip Henry Sheridan</li><li>Jefferson Davis</li><li>First Bull Run</li></ul>

<p>Poor ol' Joshua Chamberlain is way down the list at 79.</p>

<p>I haven't made my way through the book yet as I just received it so
I cannot comment on Lanning's analysis behind the rankings.&nbsp; With all
the books on the Civil War, Lanning's book might fill a niche for those
just getting into understanding the conflict.</p>
